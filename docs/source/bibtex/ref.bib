abstract = {A novel high-quality custom-made macroscope optics, dedicated to high-resolution time-resolved X-ray tomographic microscopy at the TOMCAT beamline at the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institut, Switzerland), is introduced. The macroscope offers 4{$\times$} magnification, has a very high numerical aperture of 0.35 and it is modular and highly flexible. It can be mounted both in a horizontal and vertical configuration, enabling imaging of tall samples close to the scintillator, to avoid edge-enhancement artefacts. The macroscope performance was characterized and compared with two existing in-house imaging setups, one dedicated to high spatial and one to high temporal resolution. The novel macroscope shows superior performance for both imaging settings compared with the previous systems. For the time-resolved setup, the macroscope is 4 times more efficient than the previous system and, at the same time, the spatial resolution is also increased by a factor of 6. For the high-spatial-resolution setup, the macroscope is up to 8.5 times more efficient with a moderate spatial resolution improvement (factor of 1.5). This high efficiency, increased spatial resolution and very high image quality offered by the novel macroscope optics will make 10{--}20Hz high-resolution tomographic studies routinely possible, unlocking unprecedented possibilities for the tomographic investigations of dynamic processes and radiation-sensitive samples.},

abstract = {Novel developments in X-ray sources, optics and detectors have significantly advanced the capability of X-ray microscopy at the nanoscale. Depending on the imaging modality and the photon energy, state-of-the-art X-ray microscopes are routinely operated at a spatial resolution of tens of nanometres for hard X-rays or {$\sim$}10nm for soft X-rays. The improvement in spatial resolution, however, has led to challenges in the tomographic reconstruction due to the fact that the imperfections of the mechanical system become clearly detectable in the projection images. Without proper registration of the projection images, a severe point spread function will be introduced into the tomographic reconstructions, causing the reduction of the three-dimensional (3D) spatial resolution as well as the enhancement of image artifacts. Here the development of a method that iteratively performs registration of the experimentally measured projection images to those that are numerically calculated by reprojecting the 3D matrix in the corresponding viewing angles is shown. Multiple algorithms are implemented to conduct the registration, which corrects the translational and/or the rotational errors. A sequence that offers a superior performance is presented and discussed. Going beyond the visual assessment of the reconstruction results, the morphological quantification of a battery electrode particle that has gone through substantial cycling is investigated. The results show that the presented method has led to a better quality tomographic reconstruction, which, subsequently, promotes the fidelity in the quantification of the sample morphology.},

Here a software package developed in MATLAB for script command generation and analysis of TXM data is presented. The first toolkit, the script generator, allows automating complex experimental tasks which involve up to several thousand motor movements. The second package was designed to accomplish computationally intense tasks such as data processing of mosaic and mosaic tomography datasets; dual-energy contrast imaging, where data are recorded above and below a specific X-ray absorption edge; and TXM X-ray absorption near-edge structure imaging datasets. Furthermore, analytical and iterative tomography reconstruction algorithms were implemented. The compiled software package is freely available.},

abstract={Powder-entrapped gas, which can occur naturally in gas-atomized powder, can induce porosity in parts fabricated with powder-based metal additive manufacturing processes. This study utilized synchrotron-based x-ray computed tomography and an in situ high-speed imaging technique, dynamic x-ray radiography (DXR), to investigate the formation of powder-induced porosity using 17-4 PH stainless steel powders with a controlled size distribution and intentionally varied entrapped gas contents. While powder with a low entrapped gas content showed no net part porosity increase, the results showed a strong correlation between the porosity in the powder and the porosity in the builds made from powder with a high entrapped gas content relative to typical gas-atomized powder. A threshold value was developed to classify porosity induced by powder-entrapped gas based on pore morphology measured using computed tomography. Transfer and coalescence of pores during laser melting was observed directly with DXR.},

abstract = {We present a recipe for building a portable DIY toolkit, entitled Kitchen-Based Light Tomography (KBLT) for performing tomography using visible light with low-cost and easily accessible components. We also present different use cases to mimic different challenges in tomography, such as imaging time evolving samples. All the software for motor controls, image acquisition, image reconstruction and analysis is open-sourced and available online. The fast acquisition of KBLT datasets permits 4D scanning (3D plus time), also in combination with so-called sample environments, which can support the advancement of improved image reconstruction algorithms. We believe this ‘Do it yourself’ (DIY) toolkit will be useful to tomography users, beamline scientists and computational researchers, and the tomography community in general.}
